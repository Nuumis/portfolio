        <h5>A poem by A.I. about axolotls and IT...</h5>
        <p>

          In the depths of the digital sea,
          Lurks a creature both strange and unique,
          The axolotl, with its playful grin,
          Is a master of IT, never seen.

          With its regenerative powers and sleek, slimy skin,
          The axolotl is the ultimate IT pro,
          It can fix any bug or glitch,
          And make any system run like new.

          So if you're ever in need of tech support,
          Don't hesitate to call on the axolotl,
          With its expert knowledge and quick thinking,
          It will solve your problem in a jiffy, no problem at all.

          So here's to the axolotl,
          Our IT hero of the digital deep,
          It may be small and unassuming,
          But its skills are simply elite.

        <h5>...and a poem about the struggle of owning a golden retriever</h5>
        <p>
          With a wag of its tail and a friendly bark,
          The golden retriever brings joy to our lives,
          But owning this breed comes with its fair share of struggles,
          As we're constantly put to the test.

          For starters, there's the never-ending shedding,
          Golden fur covers our clothes and our floors,
          No matter how much we vacuum and sweep,
          There's always more hair to be swept up once more.

          Then there's the boundless energy of a golden,
          They need to run and play every single day,
          Or they'll become restless and destructive,
          Chewing up our belongings in their own special way.

          But despite the challenges we face,
          We wouldn't trade our golden for anything,
          For the love and loyalty they give us,
          Is worth more than any material thing.

          So here's to our golden retrievers,
          Our loyal and loving furry friends,
          We may struggle at times, but we wouldn't have it any other way,
          Until the very end.
